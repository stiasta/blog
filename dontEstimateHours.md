Stop Estimating Hours!
=======================
Have you and your team ever caught yourselves trying to convert story points to hours when planning tasks? Today, this is exactly what happened to me and my team. We were sitting around the table planning the tasks for the upcoming sprint doint the regular planning poker. When we took the tasks from the backlog and added them to the sprint, we estimated both story points and the time we believed it would take to complete them. 

After the planning one of my team mates asked, "Why are we estimating both story points and hours?". This question lead to a team huddle were we discussed this and we concluded to stop estimating hours and only estimate hours. 

### The reason to stop estimating hours
- Estimating both hours and story points takes time.
- The velocity can be all over the place.
- Story points is easily confused with time (in hour case it was hours multiplied with a factor of 3).
- It is hard to accurately estimate hours.

### The reason for estimating story points
- Story points can become more accurate and stabilize over time.
- The velocity during a sprint can be pin-pointed.
- It can show uncertainty in the tasks (by using fibonacci).

After we concluded by only using story point we had to quicly reestimate the tasks. I read a blog post a couple of months ago that explained [The Silent Grouping Technique](http://systemagility.com/2011/05/22/using-silent-grouping-to-size-user-stories/). This activity was quite fast and we estimated 30 tasks in around 45 minutes.

This is how we completed the activity:
1. Print out all the tasks and make small flash cards with each task.
2. Each person takes one task and places it on a whiteboard without saying anything.
  - The first person places a task in the middle.
  - Then each person places a task either to the left or to the right of the tasks already placed out. Placing it to the right means that its bigger, and placing it to the left means that its smaller.
  - Continue doing this until all tasks are placed out.
3. Then each person goes up, in turn, and moves one task that he/she thinks is placed wrong.
  - This is also done without saying anything.
  - Continue until no more tasks can be moved.
  - If the one or two tasks are continually moving back and forth you should stop.
4. Agree on estimation sizes
  - This can be t-shirt sizes, fibonacci or animal sizes (we chose fibonacci because it shows uncertainty when the tasks are larger).
5. Then give each task a size from left to right.
  - Its important to continually asking yourselves, is this task twice as big or three times as large?

The estimated tasks were placed on a cardboard so that it could be used as a _answer sheet_ when we want to estimate new tasks.

After completing the first sprint with the new estimation, we will have a starting benchmark on how many story points can completed in one sprint. Then when planning the next sprint we will take in approximatly that many story points. Then over time the benchmark will normalize and become more accurate.
