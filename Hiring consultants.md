How should you properly integrate hired consultants?
==========================
Lets say your team is swamped with work and you can't finish the tasks faster than they are pouring in. There is no way to pay attention to all the projects you have. The company you work for can't afford to hire more people. Nevertheless, they can hire a consultant for around a year. 

I will describe two scenarios of how a consultant can be included into a team and how this might affect them. The assumption is that in both scenarios the team has multiple projects/customers to administer.

##Scenario 1: Budget for each project
Let's say that the company has set a side pot for each project in which can be used to different things. One of these things can be to hire a consultant. The company notices that one specific projects needs more focus and decides to go through with it. They hire a consultant. 

The company and the consultant agrees on a contract that says that the consultant has to work on the project in question. The consultant joins the team that administers the project and starts working.  

How would the team dynamic react to hiring a consultant that must work on one project, while they have to work that one and multiple others? Imagine sitting in a planning or a backlog refinement meeting and you disscuss tehe project that needs focus. When the tasks are ready the team must move on and plan tasks for the other projects. Since the consultant is not allowed to spend any time on other projects he/she is forced to leave the meeting. Both the team and the consultant might feel ackward about making he/she leave. The consultant might feel left out and the team might feel like bullies.

When the team and the consultant works on tasks the consultant might not be able to pair with the rest of the team, unless the team happen to work on and have time to work on the same project. In this case the consultant might feel lonely, and the team might have a bad conscience about that they are not able to pair up with him/her.

Is there anything good about hiring a consultant for a specific project? The company might save some expenses on the consultant not having to learn other systems and domains. But, does this make up the cost of having a more difficult team dynamic? I'm guessing there might be a crossing point of where the cost of having a broken team dynamic might supersede the cost of learning new systems and domains. But I have not been able to find any statistics on this and therefore I have to point out that this is a theory.

##Scenario 2: Budget for team
The company has a pot for hiring a consultant to the team itself, and writes a contract that allows the consultant to work on whatever the team is working on. This creates a different team dynamic. Compared to the other scenario, the consultant will not have to leave when planning, and can pair together with any of the team members.

This team dynamic will reinforce the team, and allows them to self organize. But, there is an extra cost of learning the different systems and domains.
