How should you properly integrate hired consultants?
==========================
Lets say your team is swamped with work and you can't finish the tasks faster than they are pouring in. There is no way to pay attention to all the projects you have. The company you work for can't afford to hire more people. Nevertheless, they can hire a consultant for around a year. 

I will describe two scenarios of how a consultant can be included into a team and how this might affect them. The assumption is that in both scenarios the team has multiple projects/customers to administer.

##Scenario 1: Budget for each project
Let's say that the company has set a side pot for each project in which can be used to different things. One of these things can be to hire a consultant. The company notices that one specific projects needs more focus and decides to go through with it. They hire a consultant. 

The company and the consultant agrees on a contract that says that the consultant has to work on the project in question. The consultant joins the team that administers the project and starts working.
