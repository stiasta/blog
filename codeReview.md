Code Review **(Mangler bra overskrift)**
===================
A couple of months ago my team and me had barely tried [code reviews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). This was mainly because we did not think we needed to do it and we thought that it would negatively affect our effectiveness.

The turnaround was when we took over an existing project that used [github](https://github.com) as source control. We found that when we started creating pull request and commenting on them in github. We decided to be very particular and thorough on coding standards and the way we wrote the code in the files that were changed. After doing this for a while, we saw that the code quality increased and we caught bugs that perhaps would not be found if we did not do the code reviews.

The team quickly made the code reviews a sport and strived to have the perfect code review. One where others could not find any syntax or logical errors, and those that took the code reviews tried their best to find errors. It created an "I want to write better code" culture in the team.

Even though the code reviews take time, it took, all in all, take less time because of faster [feedback loops](http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/03/agile-feedback-loops) and less bugs. Our main feedback loop was from the QA's and the customer itself. When the developer transferred the code into production it might take days before a bug might have reported. With code reviews, it took hours or minutes instead of days.

To sum it all up, here are the reasons to start performing code reviews:
- Less bugs
- Shorter feedback loops
- Higher quality code
- Team members get better understanding of the code.
